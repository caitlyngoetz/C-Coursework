OVERVIEW:

INCLUDED FILES:
	*seq-random.c - file that contains code that was the basis of theard-random.  Uses thread one thread to do a process.
	*thread-random.c - Uses multiple threads to complete a process.
	*timing.c - keeps the timing for th threads so that they know when they can join together and when to start.
	*Makefile - creates the executable and compiles the files for the project.  Also cleans up when done.
	*README - this file.

BUILDING AND RUNNING:
	From the directory containing the source files type the following in the command line to compile the project:
		$make

	You can run the program by using the executable and typing the arguments for the following command:
		$thread-random <numberOfRandoms> <numThreads>

	Where numberOfRandoms is the amount of random numbers that the program should generate.
	And where numThreads is the amount of threads you want generated.

PROGRAM DESIGN:

	This program reads in the number of threads that the user wants the program to use and the amount of random numbers
	that they want generated.  Then the program creats that many amount of threads in order to speed up the process of 
	making the random numbers.  Since they share the load the program does run faster.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISSCUSSION:
	I wasn't quite sure what the thread-random program wanted.  The write-up wasn't very difficult to read but it was hard
	to understand what it wanted from me.  If a skeleton code was supplied or a specification of what was needed to pass
	in as arguements for the methods would have been a lot better.  Other than that it went fairly smoothly once I got
	over my procrastination and the wonderful weather outside :)
