OVERVIEW:

	This program takes in a text file one element at a time and then
	it counts how many characters, digits, lines and words there are
	in it.  Then it outputs the results.

INCLUDED FILES:

	*wordcount.c - the file that does all the reading and counting
	*Makefile - the file that compiles the program and checks for errors
	*README - this file that explains the other files

BUILDING AND RUNNING:

	From the directory containing the source files, compile the files
	by typing:
		
		make

	As long as no errors were caught, you can run the program by typing:

		wordcount < [filename]

PROGRAM DESIGN:

	This program is written so that the variables get initialized and defined
	at the top before the main line is called.  Next the text file gets read
	into this program one element at a line until the end of file (EOF) is found.
	The elements are then passed through a series of if statements and the word,
	line, digit, character counts are incremented. Then once the reader hits the 
	EOF, the program stops the loop and the print statements are outputted so that
	the user can read how many of each category there is in their text file.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING DISCUSSION:

	The output that was requested when I typed in cat .git/config is here:

	[cgoetz@node24 CS253-lab]$ cat .git/config
	[core]
        	repositoryformatversion = 0
        	filemode = true
        	bare = false
        	logallrefupdates = true
	[remote "origin"]
        	url = https://github.com/BoiseState/CS253-lab
        	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	[branch "master"]
        	remote = origin
        	merge = refs/heads/master


	I did not encounter many issues with this program.  I did have some snags learning
	how to write and format in C instead of Java.  For example, some of the lines didn't
	need to end in a ';' and other strange stuff like that.  I also had a little bit of 
	an issue with the printf statements simply because I haven't worked very much with 
	them before.  They are kind of strange and I don't really get the %d thing.  But I am
	sure it will all clear up with some practice.  Besides those things I thought this 
	project went smoothly.
